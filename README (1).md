## Overview:

This project simplifies the process of extracting and managing information from business cards using optical character recognition (OCR) and a user-friendly Streamlit interface. It empowers users to:

- Upload business card images
- Extract relevant information using easyOCR
- View extracted information in a clear format
- Save information to a database (SQLite or MySQL)
- Read, update, and delete stored data through the Streamlit UI

## Problem Statement:

Develop a Streamlit application that allows users to upload a business card image, extract relevant information using easyOCR, and store it in a database. The extracted details include company name, card holder name, designation, mobile number, email, website, area, city, state, and pin code. Users should be able to manage data through the Streamlit UI, including reading, updating, and deleting entries.
- Design User Interface: Use Streamlit to create an intuitive UI. Include widgets like file uploader, buttons, and text boxes for interaction.
- Implement Image Processing and OCR: Utilize easyOCR to extract information from uploaded business card images.Apply image processing techniques for quality enhancement.
- Display Extracted Information: Present extracted details in an organized manner within the Streamlit GUI. Utilize widgets like tables, text boxes, and labels for effective display.
- Implement Database Integration: Use a chosen database management system (SQLite or MySQL). Execute SQL queries for creating tables, inserting data, and managing CRUD operations through the Streamlit UI.
- Test the Application: Thoroughly test the application functionality locally using streamlit run app.py.
- Continuous Improvement: Enhance the application by adding new features. Optimize code and address bugs. Consider adding user authentication and authorization for security.
